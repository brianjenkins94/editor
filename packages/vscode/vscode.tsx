/**
 * VS Code workbench mounted full-size in an <iframe>.
 *
 * The workbench runs inside an <iframe> (its own document) so monaco taking over `document.body`
 * never touches the host page. The iframe loads `/__vscode__/host.html`, which runs the entry
 * (workbench.js).
 *
 * Files + saves cross the iframe boundary over postMessage (same origin): the entry signals "ready"
 * → we send it the workspace `files`/`openEditors`; it posts "save" back with the edited path +
 * contents, which we hand to `onSave`. The host app must only call this once `crossOriginIsolated`
 * is true (SharedArrayBuffer).
 *
 * Singleton — monaco-vscode-api is one global workbench; subsequent calls are no-ops.
